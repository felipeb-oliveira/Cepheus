# Cepheus
Cepheus is the autonomous system for the first autonomous combat robot in Brazil. This project is dedicated to projecting, developing and manufacturing the electronic device, sensing system, and AI which controls the robot. The project is being made by the robotics team Warthog Robotics, at which I'm currently a Project Manager, in charge of managing and being the lead developer of the Cepheus Project.
